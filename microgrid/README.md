# On The Grid
#### Description: UR Hackathon 2025 Project - A website that calculates the number of solar panels needed for the inputted electricty usage in KWH
#### Future Capabilities:
- options for different types of solar panels
- input other types of non-renewable energy to offset with sustainable options
- options for other types of sustainable energy generation like wind turbines and energy storage
- make renewable energy types and numbers recommendations by optimizing the highest efficiency for the lowest cost
- physically design the microgrid layout, including calculations to determine if your infrastructure will support the implemenations of the desired plan
- more accurate offset percentages that will factor in external variables like weather
- calculations for how much excess energy can be sold to SaskPower
- calculations to determine when the upfront code of the sustainable energy options plus regular maintenance will be paid for with savings
